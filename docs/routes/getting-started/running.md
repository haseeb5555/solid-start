# Running the project

You can run your app locally with

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
# pnpm
pnpm dev
```

Your application should now be running locally on port 3000. You can view it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Note:** What happens is that `vinxi dev` is being called. SolidStart uses [Vinxi](https://vinxi.vercel.app/) both for starting a development server with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and for building and starting a production server with [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/).

You can read more about the Vinxi CLI, and how it can be configured [here](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/cli.html).
